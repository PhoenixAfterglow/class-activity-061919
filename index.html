                <p>Johnny Maravelis is the son of 2 immigrant parents.  Both parents are Mediterranean.  Johnny
                    grew up in Wilmington, MA.  It is a boring town, filled with lots of grannies.  You know it's 
                    generally a quiet town when the main retail stores includes, but not limits to, Savers, Dollar Tree,
                    and yeah that's about it.  (OK so maybe there's a Market Basket and 6 Dunkin Donuts).
                </p>
                <p>It should be of no surprise that the youth of Wilmington, MA typically turn to drugs &mdash; marijuana to
                    be exact.
