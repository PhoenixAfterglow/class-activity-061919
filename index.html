            <h1>He May Not Be "The Most Interesting Man in the World"</h1>
            <h2>(But He Makes A Close 2nd)</h2>
                <p>Johnny Maravelis is the son of 2 immigrant parents.  Both parents are Mediterranean.  Johnny
                    grew up in "<a href="https://www.wilmingtonma.gov/">Wilmington, MA</a>.  It is a boring town, filled with lots of grannies.  You know it's 
                    generally a quiet town when the main retail stores includes, but not limits to, Savers, Dollar Tree,
                    and yeah that's about it.  (OK so maybe there's a Market Basket and 6 Dunkin Donuts).
                </p>
                <p>It should be of no surprise that the youth of Wilmington, MA typically turn to drugs &mdash; marijuana to
                    be exact.  But, smoking herb wasn't a satisfying escape for Johnny, so he decided to hop on a plane to 
                    California.  At the time, he only had $300 in his wallet.  He had no job, no home, and wasn't enrolled 
                    into a college.  Looking back, this is <i>absolutely</i> a crazy thing to do, now knowing that
                    Los Angeles is the "homeless capitol of the world."
